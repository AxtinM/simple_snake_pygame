# Snake Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame library.

## Features

- Snake moves continuously and player controls the direction of the snake.
- The snake grows in length as it eats the food (represented by a red square).
- The game ends when the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen and increases by one for each food eaten.
